# Java-Chat-Server-Client
The aim is to create an encrypted messaging application using a server-client architecture. The design includes both server and client applications using the Java Swing library. In the server application, the user will enter the port number to put the server in listening mode. In the client application, the user will enter the server's IP address and port number to establish a connection with the server. Afterward, messaging between the server and client will take place. During messaging, an encryption method is derived. When the client sends a message, it will be encrypted according to the encryption algorithm and then sent to the server. The server will decrypt this message and display it on the screen. The same encryption and decryption processes are performed for messages sent from the server to the client.
